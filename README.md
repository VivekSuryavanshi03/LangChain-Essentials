### Key Features:
- Easy integration with APIs and databases.
- Flexible pipeline design to handle various LLM workflows.
- Tool and retriever wrappers for connecting to external sources like Wikipedia, Arxiv, and DuckDuckGo.
- Support for advanced agents and decision-making models.
- Compatibility with major language models such as Llama, OpenAI, and Grok.
